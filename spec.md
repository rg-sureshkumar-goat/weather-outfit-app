# Technical Specification

> EDITING DIRECTIVE: DEVELOPER AND AGENT EDIT THIS FILE COLLABORATIVELY. THE DEVELOPER MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE ITS CONTENT.

Purpose of this file: Turn the approved research, project brief, and hand-drawn screen designs into testable requirements.

## Instructions for the Developer

Make and approve the product decisions, draw every proposed screen, provide the drawings to the Agent, and keep this file current as the intended result changes.

To begin, open the project repository in a fresh chat and enter:

`Read ./spec.md and help me begin the Project 3 specification.`

## Instructions for the Agent

Read `AGENTS.md`, `brief.md`, `research.md`, and this file. Review the screen drawings the Developer provides. Ask one focused question at a time, surface gaps and trade-offs without inventing requirements, and keep the specification concise and testable.

## Goal

State what the app should help its Users accomplish and name the user story or stories that define that need.

## Screen designs

Draw every proposed screen by hand, in both phone and laptop layouts, on paper, a tablet, a whiteboard, or another hand-drawing surface. Save photos or exports in `reference/`, provide them to the Agent, and link them here. Use the drawings to define layout, hierarchy, controls, navigation, and important interaction states.

## Requirements

Translate every fixed brief requirement and the selected research-driven feature into a testable requirement. Define the chosen behavior, content, controls, current and forecast data, responsive layout, accessibility, error handling, privacy, credits, and deployment. The main screen should make clear the location, date, units, data source, and whether conditions are current or forecast. Include an acceptance check for each requirement.

## Recommendation state and data flow

Define the weather inputs, recommendation categories, coded rules, and shared state. Weather values must come from the provider, and rules must follow the weather guidance cited in `research.md`. The selected location, date, and live weather data must produce one recommendation state that drives every visual and written output.

## Content variation

Define at least three outfit variations for each recommendation category and at least three wording variations for each reminder type. Define how outfit and reminder variations are chosen independently at random, and how a previously selected date keeps the same variations, including whether they persist after the page reloads.

## Assets

List every art and graphical asset: the character, each outfit variation, icons, and any other visuals. For each, note where it appears, its format, and whether it will be created, generated, or licensed, with its credit or license.

## Out of scope

Record features intentionally excluded from this project.

## Revisions

After implementation or testing, record requirement changes and the evidence that prompted them. Update the screen drawings when a material layout or interaction changes.

## Approval

The Developer reviews and explicitly approves this specification and its screen designs before planning begins.

## Saving the transcript

After the Developer approves the specification, ask them to enter `save transcript`. When directed, save the complete conversation as `transcripts/spec-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`, label chat messages `Developer` and `Agent`, and confirm the saved path.
